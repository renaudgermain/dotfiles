# /home/rcog/.moosic/config
# This file associates filetypes with commands which play them.
#
# The format of this file is as follows:  Every pair of lines forms a unit.
# The first line in a pair is a regular expression that will be matched against
# items in the play list.  The second line in a pair is the command that will
# be used to play any items that match the regular expression.  The name of the
# item to be played will be appended to the end of this command line.
#
# The command will not be interpreted by a shell, so don't bother trying to use
# shell variables or globbing or I/O redirection, and be mindful of how you use
# quotes and parentheses.  If you need any of these fancy features, wrap up the
# command in a real shell script (and remember to use an "exec" statement to
# invoke the program that does the actual song playing, otherwise Moosic won't
# be able to do things like stop or pause the song).
#
# Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.  Regular
# expressions specified earlier in this file take precedence over those
# specified later.
